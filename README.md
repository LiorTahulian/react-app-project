## Description

The site provides a service for people who want to train and run with other people. The site also provides the possibility to save cards of people with whom you would like to train.

My motivation for building the site is that there is no platform for people who want to train collaboratively. That's why I built this site.

I am a person who likes to train in a group and I have not found an adequate solution to the problem of training independently.
